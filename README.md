# Hi 

I'm Tatsuki Odake, a PhD student in the Department of Physics at the University of Tokyo, supervised by Prof. Mio Murao.

My research is on
- Quantum algorithms
- Higher-order quantum transformations
- Quantum machine learning

I am interested in interdisciplinary research using many different theories.
